  <p>In&nbsp;online test games, there&nbsp;is usually a limited number of lives: if, for example, you make 3 mistakes, you lose and do not continue with the game. Imagine you are trying to implement that system to an existing online test that doesn't have it yet.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>A line with <strong>N</strong>&nbsp;scores of a user in a test game separated by a space: <strong>C&nbsp;</strong>for the correct answer and <strong> I&nbsp;</strong>for the incorrect answer.&nbsp;<strong>N&nbsp;</strong>will be between 15 and 50.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>If the user loses the game, print "<strong>Game over"&nbsp;</strong>and their score (how many correct answers they&nbsp;gave).&nbsp;If the user wins, print&nbsp;<strong>"You won"&nbsp;</strong> and their score. The message should be printed without&nbsp;quotation marks. The message and the score should be printed on separate lines.</p>
