  <p>John works at the university. He deals with the information about a lot of students and he decided to create a program that would help him with it.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>He devised a system for creating an <strong>id</strong> for each student: first letter of the name, last name and then the birth year. For example, the id for John Smith (b. 1989) would look like <code class="java">JSmith1989</code>.</p> 
  <p>John needs help finishing the code for the id and then applying it to the students. Create an instance attribute&nbsp;<strong>id&nbsp;</strong>in the <code class="java">__init__</code> method, calculate it and then print its value for the student.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>Student information: the first line has <strong>the name</strong>, the second has <strong>the last name</strong>, and the third has <strong>the birth year</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The&nbsp;<strong>id&nbsp;</strong>of the student.</p>
